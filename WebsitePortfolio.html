            <p>You're probaby wondering "who the heck is this guy? and why would his alias be something I can't quite say correctly?"

                When they talk about its legendary leader, that man of indomitable spirit, that paragon of masculinity,

            <p>coming from himself directed towards his foe is all you'll ever be able to recall</p>
            <p>he never worries, never hesistates, backs down, or wavers when all odds are against himself</p>
